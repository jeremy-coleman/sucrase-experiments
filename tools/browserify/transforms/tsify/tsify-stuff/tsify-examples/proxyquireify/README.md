# tsify Sample: proxyquireify

A trivial TypeScript project that uses proxyquireify to stub a module.

Based on the [proxyquireify example](https://github.com/thlorenz/proxyquireify#example).

## Building

Check out the scripts in `package.json` for an example on how to run a build with the API.

```sh
npm run build-script
```

## Running

Run the bundle under Node.js:

```sh
node bundle
```

You should see the results from the stubbed `bar.js` module's functions written to the console.
